[Node](http://nodejs.org/) is really easy to install & now include [NPM](https://npmjs.org/).
You should be able to run the following command after the installation procedure
below.

    $ node --version
    v16.16.0

    $ npm --version
    9.2.0

#### Node installation on OS X

You will need to use a Terminal. On OS X, you can find the default terminal in
`/Applications/Utilities/Terminal.app`.

Please install [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) if it's not already done with the following command.

    $ ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/go/install)"

If everything when fine, you should run

    brew install node

#### Node installation on Linux

    sudo apt-get install python-software-properties
    sudo add-apt-repository ppa:chris-lea/node.js
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install nodejs

#### Node installation on Windows

## Install

    $ git clone https://github.com/0101-Solutions/ggghs-sms-frontend.git
    $ cd ggghs-sms-frontend
    $ npm install

### Configure app

Ensure the backend is running and edit the configs on how to start in production and development.

## Start & watch

    $ npm run dev

## Preview build & build for production

    $ npm run preview
    $ npm run build

## Update sources

Some packages usages might change so you should run `npm prune` & `npm install` often.
A common way to update is by doing

    $ git pull
    $ npm prune
    $ npm install

To run those 3 commands you can just do

    $ npm run pull

**Note:** Unix user can just link the `git-hooks/post-merge`:

### `post-merge` (â‰ƒ `npm install`)

This hook will `npm prune && npm install` each time you `git pull` something if the `package.json` has been modified.
